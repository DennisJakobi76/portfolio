	Hi, I'm Dennis – a code enthusiast with a passion for modern web technologies and well-designed software. I've been
	developing since 2016, rooted in backend (.NET/C#) and increasingly drawn to the frontend.
	What drives me is the joy of coding: creating things, solving problems creatively, and constantly learning – that’s
	what this job means to me.
